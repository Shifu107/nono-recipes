        <p>The lemon in this gives the dish a bright flavor and balances the sugar well. You could pre-cook your carrots and then re-warm and glaze just before serving. Thanks!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 carrots, sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Place carrots into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until carrots are tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, brown sugar, and lemon juice in the melted butter, stirring often, until sugar has dissolved, 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
