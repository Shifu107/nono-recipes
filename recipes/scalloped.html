        <h4>This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. It is a favorite at Easter in my family. The egg whites add a touch of lightness to it.</h4>
        <p>Veganized every thing. Made my own homemade vegan bread. For all the vegans please tell me how it taste.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
            <li>1 Â½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
